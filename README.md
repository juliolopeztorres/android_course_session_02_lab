Fruit World
==============

Second task of Android's course from Udemy website

The goal here is to get a SPA in which you could find a list of fruit. You could 
choose from grid to list view, add new fruits and delete those by context menu.

It is used ViewHolder pattern in Adapters in order to get more efficiency when 
showing the list.

I tried to following certain patterns as Clean Code Book with meaningful names, list down pattern (as newspapers).
 
# Usage

Copy it and build with Android Studio. 

Enjoy!
